# Tunnel Focus: Time Your Tasks
## Code Institute Milestone Project 2: Interactive Front-End Development

This is a task manager with a difference. 
Breaking large projects up into smaller tasks is a great way to get things done efficiently. 

Sometimes focusing on a task "until it's done" is not a good way to get things done, as your mind can wander and concentration can lag.

Focusing in small bursts and maintaining intense focus for small periods of time, punctuated by regular breaks can yield massive benefits in terms of work effiency.

This web application has been conceptualised and designed around that premise. 

It works as a simple task manager, except that it also keeps track of how long a user works on a particular task. The app is built to encourage and track a sprint-like methodology, or focused work for 
shorter periods of time.
